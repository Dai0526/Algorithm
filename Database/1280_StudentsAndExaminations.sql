Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Order the result table by student_id and subject_name.

The query result format is in the following example:

Students table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |
+------------+--------------+
Subjects table:
+--------------+
| subject_name |
+--------------+
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |
+--------------+
Examinations table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | subject_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |

| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |
+------------+--------------+
Result table:
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended Math exam 3 times, Physics exam 2 times and Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended Math exam 1 time, Programming exam 1 time and didn't attend the Physics exam.
Alex didn't attend any exam.
John attended Math exam 1 time, Physics exam 1 time and Programming exam 1 time.

注意选择正确的 subject_name

如果用了Examinations.subject_name，会出现科目不匹配导致null的情况
