1. get a user_id, totol distance Table
2. JOIN with user and sort

Write an SQL query to report the distance travelled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, if two or more users travelled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+

Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.
