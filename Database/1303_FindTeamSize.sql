Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |

Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |

Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.



IDEA: Create a teamid - count table, then find

*/

SELECT employee_id, team_size
FROM Employee JOIN (SELECT team_id, COUNT(team_id) as team_size
     FROM Employee
     GROUP BY team_id) As teamInfo
WHERE teamInfo.team_id = Employee.team_id
GROUP BY employee_id;
