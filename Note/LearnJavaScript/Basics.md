## Variables

Define a Variable
```
var name = "Tom"
let name = "Tom"
const name = "Tom"
```

Naming Convention:  
1. Both Camel or Snake cases are good.   
2. Consistent
```
let userId = ''    # Camel
let user_id = ''   # Snake
```

## Data Type
JavaScript is a dynamic language, and you donâ€™t have to define the type of variables when you define them.

```
let user_id;
user_id = int 12;       # number
user_id = "string 12"   # string
```
