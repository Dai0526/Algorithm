Problem 1
Create a graph. If an actor or actress has direct connection with Kevin Bacon,
add an edge with weight 1, and direction is from this actor to KB. If an actor 
or actress has no direct connection with KB, then connect it with other actors
 and set the edge with weight 1 and direction from this actor to the other one.

a) If we want to find the Bacon number, we just get the shortest path from 
this actor to KB.

b) loop over the graph, and get the Bacon number for each pair, store the max one
and return it at last.


c) 
Since all the weight of edges are 1, we can run a Breadth First Search for 
this graph between this two actors.




Problem 2

a) For a general map, if a map has cycle, it will repeated the cycle and the recursion will never stop (infinite loop).


b) Because a acyclic graph doesn't have cycle, so it will always make progress and reach the base case in the end.


c) The worst case is go through all the nodes and the run time is big-O(N).
