Problem 1

2^(n+1)>N!>(3^n=2^n)>42N³>N²>N log N>23N>log N>2/N>sqrt(N)>128

Problem 2
1. Big-O(n^2)=n^2

2. Big-O(23n)=n

3. Big-O= logk/logn

Problem 3
a). 
Move the car at the front of the input track to the back of of the output track.
Move the car at the front of the input track to the top of one of the holding tracks.
Move the car at the top of one of the holding tracks to the back of the output track.

Move 3 to S1
Move 6 to S2
Move 9 to S3
Move 2 to S1
Move 4 to S2
Move 7 to S3
Move 1 to S1
Move 1 to output
Move 2 to output
Move 3 to output
Move 8 to S1
Move 5 to S1
Move 4 to output
Move 5 to output
Move 6 to output
Move 7 to output
Move 8 to output
Move 9 to output

 
b). Yes, there is a solution for any train of length 9 with 3 holding tracks.
Step 1: if all three stack are empty
	Move the car at the front of the input track to one of the top of the empty holding tracks.

Step 2: if the front of input smaller than top of HT1
		put on top of HT 1
   	else if the front of input smaller than top of HT2
		put on top of HT 2 
   	else if the front of input smaller than top of HT3
		put on top of HT 3 
   	else push the smallest top of the holding tracks to output track until one holding stack is empty(back to step 1) 
   		or the front of input is smaller than one of the top of the holding tracks(to step 2).

        if input stack is empty and all 3 holding stacks are empty
		finish the rearranging.	
		
It works because it will always try to fill the empty stack in order to check if there is minimun #
of train that can be arrange to the tracks.
