Problem 1

AC -2
DG -2
DE -3
FH -5
CF -7
CD -7
FG -8
BE -8
CG -9
BD -10
Show the forest maintained after each step:
AC
AC DG
AC DG DE
AC DG DE FH
AC DG DE FH CF
AC DG DE FH CF FG
AC DG DE FH CF FG BE



Problem 2

 A --10--C
  \       \ -9
  1\       \     
    B --3-- D --2--E
 By  Dijkstra's algorithm, it will go

A-B-D-E, and the cose will be 5
but the shortest path is A-C-D-E which the cost is 3


Problem 3  
We can set two marks to vertex, every time we pass through one vertex,
we label the next one with different mark, when there is a contridiction
of the marks on a single vertex, it means the graph is not a bipartite.

1.get the node, mark this node with label (V1)
2.check all the nodes connected to it, and mark them (V2)
3.go through nodes marked as (V2), checek all the nodes connected to them, and mark (V1)
repeate step 1-3, until there is a mark contridiction.
